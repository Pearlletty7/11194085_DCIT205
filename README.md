## Testing

The website has been extensively tested on modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Responsive testing has also been performed on various devices to ensure a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.

## Known Issues

I'd like to first mention that the biggest problems I encountered during this project were stupid and idiotic typos; simple things like accidentally putting a colon where a semicolon belongs (for the last method of a class of all cases! Gave me weird errors about no constructor body) or dumb errors in, which caused all sorts of weird compiling issues. During the development process, some issues were encountered, including typos and minor errors. These issues have been addressed and resolved to the best of my knowledge. If you encounter any issues while using the website, please report them, and I will investigate and fix them promptly.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Christabel Araba Edumadze for her invaluable assistance throughout the entire project. Her guidance and support were instrumental in creating an impressive website that can inspire and motivate many individuals.

## What I Learnt

Throughout the process of creating this website project, I started as a beginner and learned a lot. I gained experience using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they taught me many valuable skills. HTML helped me structure content and incorporate different types of media. CSS allowed me to improve the website's visual appeal, and arrange elements on the page. JavaScript enabled me to add interactivity and create dynamic features like clickable buttons. I encountered and resolved various challenges, which improved my problem-solving skills. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me, and it made me even more excited about web development. Iâ€™d love to add that my implementation of this homework website creation is what I call the "Smart way". In other words, I tried to make my life as easy as possible while still maintaining the guidelines.
