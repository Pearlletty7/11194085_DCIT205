      <h2>Welcome To The Computer Science Department</h2>
      <p>
        The computer science department is a part of the College of Basic and
        Applied Sciences. We offer programs for students who want to study
        computer science. The department has courses for undergraduate and
        postgraduate students. Undergraduate students can earn a Bachelor of
        Science (BSc) degree in Computer Science, while postgraduate students
        can pursue Master of Philosophy (MPhil) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
        degrees in computer science. The department focuses on teaching and
        researching different areas of computer science like programming,
        algorithms, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and more. The
        faculty members are knowledgeable and experienced in their fields. They
        help students learn and conduct research projects. The department has
        computer labs, a library, and other resources to support students in
        their studies. They may also collaborate with other institutions and
        industry partners to provide additional learning and research
        opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our courses are designed to combat the shortage of highly skilled
        graduates in the computing industry, which means excellent employment
        prospects. Keeping in mind that the university departments have their
        own responsibility to bring out skilled and competent professionals to
        face global challenges with the new insights of problem-solving
        abilities, the Department of Computer Science, admitting students from
        all over the world, is rendering such an important responsibility by
        producing Computer Science professionals competent enough to fulfill the
        industrial and research needs of the world. The mission of producing
        able and competent Computer Science professionals in the department is
        being achieved due to the involvement of highly dedicated and competent
        faculty members. We are continuously progressing year after year as we
        are sincerely committed towards the goal of promoting not only the
        department but also the institution as a whole. Our students have been
        able to make a mark for themselves by their services offered in
        different parts of the world on behalf of their nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its founding, the Department has expanded rapidly in enrolment,
        curriculum, staff, equipment, research and services to the community, in
        both quality and quantity. Currently, the Department offers programmes
        leading to BSc, MPhil and PhD degrees. The Department has the most
        advanced computing equipment and cloud infrastructure for both Computer
        Science and Computer Engineering research. The Department of Computer
        Science has a distinguished track record of academic excellence and
        major achievement in a vital, rapidly evolving field. Our faculty
        combines high-quality teaching with cutting-edge research in a broad
        spectrum of theoretical and applied areas. Our alumni are pursued by
        top technology companies as well as major employers in a variety of
        sectors, including finance, aerospace engineering, entertainment, health
        care, and education. Many go on to earn advanced degrees in computer
        science, law, management, and medicine at some of the best universities.
        Our students are recruited for internships at leading companies and
        research laboratories. Our PhD graduates go on to research and teaching
        careers around the world. The department offers a broad range of courses
        at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, providing an education to
        last a lifetime in a fast-changing field. While making sure that our
        students are competitive on the job market the moment they graduate, we
        teach problem-solving techniques that apply regardless of the particular
        fashions of the day.
