            <h4>Senior Software Engineer | PhD Candidate</h4>

            <p>
              For me, there really isn't a question here. I have had a mystical
              attraction to computers ever since I was a child. I never really
              chose computer science, it chose me. The most important aspect I
              liked from studying computer science at University of Ghana is the
              problem solving, the essential skill for life. Because computers
              solve problems, to serve people, there is a significant human side
              of computer science as well. I really râ€‹ecommend computer science
              at University of Ghana to people to study it.

            <p>
              Mr. Mark Atta Mensah is a computer science instructor at the
              University of Ghana, in Accra, the capital. He holds Master of
              Philosophy in Computer Science from that same university.
              Formerly, he was an instructor at BlueCrest University College, a
              business, technology, and fashion institute.

            <h4>
              Senior Lecturer PhD.(London), PGCE, QTS, (London), MSc. (Scotland)
              MEng.(Distinction) (former USSR), Dip. Ed. (Russian Language)

            <p>
              My current research focus is on wireless communications- wireless
              systems will play a major role in future communication systems
              particularly in developing countries where the infrastructural
              costs of deploying wired lines are proving prohibitive. The
              deployment of increasing number of wireless systems will bring in
              its wake a number of problems including spectral congestion and
              the need to employ better and sophisticated frequency planning
              techniques. Cognitive radio has emerged as preferred way of
              building intelligent radio systems that are capable of interacting
              with their environment and making real time decisions.
