            <p>
              For me, there really isn't a question here. I have had a mystical
              attraction to computers ever since I was a child. I never really
              chose computer science, it chose me. The most important aspect I
              liked from studying computer science at University of Ghana is the
              problem solving, the essential skill for life. Because computers
              solve problems, to serve people, there is a significant human side
              of computer science as well. I really r​ecommend computer science
              at University of Ghana to people to study it.

              “To me, what made Brock University and UoG computer science
              department so great is its spirit. The faculty and the staff are
              always willing to lend a hand and give advice or answer questions
              when needed. The other students are friendly and approachable and
              it’s fun to discuss side projects and share experiences with them.
              At UoG computer science department, I feel encouraged to be the
              best version of myself, and that is something that persists even
              now.”

              foreign students like myself to feel welcomed in foreign country
              by providing support and high level of education. Also, as a

              but only an encouragement, motivation and great support from a
              faculty who wants me to succeed.

            <p>
              “I’ve known that I would be going into the field of Computer
              Science for as long as I can remember. When I was growing up I
              would always be on the lookout for the latest and greatest
              technology I could get my hands on. In high school I took a few
              computer programming classes and that’s when I knew this was
              something I’d be focusing on for the rest of my life. I chose
              University of Ghana for the intimate learning environment as well
              as the brand new Science and Technology Center. I heard the
              Computer Science program was excellent and it seems that claim is
              just as accurate now as it was four years ago when I heard it
              first. During my studies at the University of Ghana I learned a
              lot more than just programming. Complex problem solving and
              software design are skills that have been invaluable in the
              interview process I went through just a few months ago. In my
              opinion, the Software Engineering course I took last semester was
              by far the most useful class in the program and a fitting
              conclusion to the Computer Science curriculum. Thanks to the
              skills I’ve acquired at the University of Ghana computer science
              department, I was able to acquire a full-time job offer working
              for Oracle Primavera immediately after I graduated. I wouldn’t be
              where I am today without the support of my family, my friends and
              my education the University of Ghana Computer Science University.”
