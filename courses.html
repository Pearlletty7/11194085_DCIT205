            <h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>

            <p>
              Our Applied Artificial Intelligence MSc covers fundamental
              concepts and practical skills in AI and its real-world
              applications. In addition to a solid foundation in Artificial
              Intelligence, key topics include Machine Learning, Neural
              Networks, Deep Learning, Big Data, Computer Vision, and Generative
              AI. This programme is designed with an industry focus and will
              provide students with a solid understanding of AI processes and
              techniques through a combination of theoretical and practical
              instruction. This course is ideal for IT and computing graduates
              who wish to expand their knowledge and skills in the field of
              Artificial Intelligence. It is also applicable to professionals
              seeking to upskill in the latest industry developments, or
              transition into a new field.

            <h3>Computer Networks Fundamentals</h3>

            <p>
              This course introduces fundamental concepts in the design and
              implementation of computer communication networks, their protocols
              and applications. Topics covered include layered network
              architecture, physical layer and data link protocols; and
              transport protocols; routing protocols and applications. Most case
              studies are drawn from the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite. How
              does the global network infrastructure work and what are the
              design principles on which it is based? In what ways are these
              design principles compromised in practice? How do we make it work
              better in today’s world? How do we ensure that it will work well
              in the future in the face of rapidly growing scale and
              heterogeneity? And how should Internet applications be written, so
              they can obtain the best possible performance both for themselves
              and for others using the infrastructure? These are some issues
              that are grappled with in this course. The course will focus on
              the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation of
              large-scale networked systems.

            <h3>Information Security And Ethical Hacking</h3>

            <p>
              This course aims to provide you with a strong practical and
              theoretical understanding of cybersecurity, hacking, digital
              forensics, security operations and the underlying associated
              computer science. We believe that the best way of learning is
              through doing - applying the theoretical concepts to practical
              problems. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on the
              practical development of work, with a significant portion of your
              time being spent on assisted lab tasks, which may involve live
              practical hacking challenges, seminars discussing topics such as
              cryptography and secrecy or project-based classes, which may
              involve more in-depth work developing secure systems in hostile
              environments
